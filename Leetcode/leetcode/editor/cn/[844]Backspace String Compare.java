/**
Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed 
into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character. 

 Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty. 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
 

 Example 3: 

 
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200 
 s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters. 
 

 
 Follow up: Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
